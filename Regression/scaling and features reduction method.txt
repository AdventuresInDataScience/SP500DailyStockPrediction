Now lets say instead of an iterable, I have a functions called add_features1(), add_features2() etc. I want to input a df, and return the same df but with the new features calculated, then scaled, then reduced down by PCA. I want this done over every add_features function, with a final result being a df with just the PCA'd features, as well as a final PCA and scaler model. I would also like an example of how I would then use this on new data

1. Define Your Feature Engineering Functions
Assuming these functions modify the input dataframe by adding new features:

python
Copy code
def add_features1(df):
    # Example: Adding new features to df
    df['new_feature_1'] = df['existing_feature'] * 2
    return df

def add_features2(df):
    # Example: Adding new features to df
    df['new_feature_2'] = df['existing_feature'] ** 2
    return df

# Add more feature functions as needed...
2. Pipeline for Incremental PCA with Scaling
This code will process each batch of features, scaling them with StandardScaler and reducing them with IncrementalPCA.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import IncrementalPCA

# Assuming df is your initial dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'existing_feature': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Replace with actual data
})

# Initialize StandardScaler and IncrementalPCA
scaler = StandardScaler()
n_components = 10  # Adjust based on desired dimensionality
ipca = IncrementalPCA(n_components=n_components)

# List of your feature functions
feature_functions = [add_features1, add_features2]  # Add more as needed

# Process each feature function incrementally
for add_features_fn in feature_functions:
    # Generate new features
    df = add_features_fn(df)
    
    # Select only the newly added features to scale and reduce
    new_features = df.iloc[:, -10_000:]  # Adjust based on the number of new features
    
    # Scale and update the scaler model
    scaled_features = scaler.partial_fit_transform(new_features)
    
    # Apply IncrementalPCA and update the PCA model
    reduced_features = ipca.partial_fit_transform(scaled_features)
    
    # Replace the new features with the reduced ones in the dataframe
    df = df.iloc[:, :-10_000]  # Remove the old batch of new features
    reduced_df = pd.DataFrame(reduced_features, index=df.index)
    df = pd.concat([df, reduced_df], axis=1)

# The df now contains only the final reduced features
3. Using the Final Scaler and PCA on New Data
You can now use the fitted scaler and ipca models to process new data.

python
Copy code
def process_new_data(new_df):
    # Apply all feature engineering functions
    for add_features_fn in feature_functions:
        new_df = add_features_fn(new_df)
        
        # Select only the newly added features to scale and reduce
        new_features = new_df.iloc[:, -10_000:]  # Adjust based on number of new features
        
        # Scale using the saved scaler
        scaled_features = scaler.transform(new_features)
        
        # Reduce using the saved PCA model
        reduced_features = ipca.transform(scaled_features)
        
        # Replace the new features with the reduced ones in the dataframe
        new_df = new_df.iloc[:, :-10_000]  # Remove the old batch of new features
        reduced_df = pd.DataFrame(reduced_features, index=new_df.index)
        new_df = pd.concat([new_df, reduced_df], axis=1)
    
    return new_df

# Example usage with new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'existing_feature': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # Replace with actual new data
})

processed_new_data = process_new_data(new_data)
Explanation:
Feature Engineering Loop: Each add_features function is applied sequentially, generating new features. Only the new features from each step are scaled and reduced.

Partial Fitting: StandardScaler and IncrementalPCA are updated incrementally using partial_fit_transform for the training data. This allows them to learn from the new data added in each step.

Final Model: After processing all feature functions, the final dataframe (df) contains only the reduced features.

New Data Processing: The process_new_data function shows how to apply the same transformations to new data, ensuring consistency with the training data.

This approach scales well with large datasets and ensures that you only need to maintain a single StandardScaler and IncrementalPCA model, reducing the complexity of handling many features.  


This final set of features can then be scaled again using UMAP
